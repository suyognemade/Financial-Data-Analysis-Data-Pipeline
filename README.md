## Overview

This project builds a scalable and reliable **data pipeline** designed to process, analyze, and visualize **company stock data**. The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and analysis, providing financial analysts, traders, and stakeholders with valuable insights into stock performance and market trends.

The pipeline uses **Apache Spark** for data transformation, **AWS S3** for scalable storage, **PostgreSQL** for structured querying, and **Tableau** for real-time dashboards. The **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for monitoring pipeline health and performance, while **Gmail** is integrated to send automated notifications of pipeline status or stock alerts.

---

## Architecture

![Pipeline Architecture](link_to_architecture_image)

The architecture consists of multiple stages to handle the ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization of stock data. Below is a high-level breakdown:

1. **Ingestion**: Data from stock market APIs (like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance) is ingested into **AWS S3** using **Apache Airflow** for orchestration.
2. **Transformation**: **Apache Spark** processes the raw data, calculating metrics such as moving averages, volatility, and price-to-earnings ratios.
3. **Storage**: Transformed data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, a relational database on AWS.
4. **Visualization**: **Tableau** connects to PostgreSQL and provides real-time dashboards for stock analysis.
5. **Monitoring**: The **ELK Stack** monitors pipeline performance, while **Filebeat** collects logs from each stage and forwards them to **Logstash**. **Kibana** visualizes log data, and alerts are sent via **Gmail** for pipeline errors or stock price notifications.

## Features

### Ingestion
- Automated ingestion of stock market data at specified intervals (e.g., hourly, daily).
- Scalable storage of raw stock data in AWS S3.
- Support for multiple stock data APIs.

### Transformation
- Real-time data processing with Apache Spark.
- Calculation of key financial metrics: moving averages, volatility, PE ratios, etc.
- Data cleaning and validation during transformation.

### Storage and Querying
- Structured data storage in PostgreSQL.
- Easy-to-query stock data using SQL for reporting or further analysis.

### Visualization
- Real-time stock performance dashboards using Tableau.
- Customizable views for financial analysts and traders.

### Monitoring and Alerts
- Real-time monitoring of pipeline performance with the ELK Stack.
- Automated alerts for stock price changes or pipeline failures using Gmail notifications.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages a variety of tools for big data processing, orchestration, storage, and monitoring:

- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and transformation.
- **AWS S3**: For raw and processed data storage.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing transformed data and running SQL queries.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing real-time stock performance dashboards.
- **Apache Airflow**: For scheduling and orchestrating the data ingestion and processing pipeline.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For monitoring the pipeline, collecting logs, and creating alerts.
- **Filebeat**: To forward log data from various pipeline stages to Logstash.
- **Gmail**: For sending email notifications of stock alerts or pipeline failures.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **AWS account**: For S3 storage and PostgreSQL (AWS RDS).
- **Apache Spark**: Installed locally or on AWS EMR.
- **Apache Airflow**: For pipeline orchestration.
- **PostgreSQL**: For structured data storage.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing data (or another BI tool if preferred).
- **ELK Stack**: For pipeline monitoring (Filebeat, Logstash, Elasticsearch, Kibana).

### Cloning the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/financial-data-pipeline.git
cd financial-data-pipeline
```

### AWS S3 Setup

1.  Create an S3 bucket in your AWS account to store raw and processed stock data.
2.  Update your DAGs in `dags/ingest_data.py` to point to the correct S3 bucket.

### Apache Spark Installation

1.  Install Apache Spark locally or configure an AWS EMR cluster.
2.  Verify installation by running:
    ```bash
    spark-shell
    ```

### Apache Airflow Setup

1.  Follow the [Airflow installation guide](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/start.html).
2.  Place the DAGs from the `dags/` folder into your Airflow DAGs directory.
3.  Start the Airflow scheduler:
    ```bash
    airflow scheduler
    ```

### PostgreSQL Setup

1.  Set up a PostgreSQL instance using AWS RDS or locally.
2.  Run the SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder to create tables and insert data:
    ```bash
    psql -h <host> -U <user> -d <dbname> -f sql/create_tables.sql
    ```

### Tableau Setup

1.  Connect Tableau to the PostgreSQL instance.
2.  Use the provided Tableau workbook (`tableau/stock_dashboard.twbx`) to create visualizations.

### ELK Stack Setup

1.  Follow the [official Elastic Stack guide](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elastic-stack-get-started/current/get-started-docker.html) to install Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
2.  Update `filebeat.yml` and `logstash.conf` with your environment details.

## Running the Pipeline

### Step 1: Ingest Data
Run the Airflow DAG to ingest data from stock APIs into S3.

### Step 2: Transform Data
Run the Spark jobs to process and clean the raw stock data and calculate financial metrics.

### Step 3: Store Data
The processed data is stored in PostgreSQL, where you can query it using SQL.

### Step 4: Visualize Data
Use Tableau to connect to PostgreSQL and generate real-time stock dashboards.

### Step 5: Monitor the Pipeline
Use Kibana to monitor logs and system health, and set up alerts for any issues.

## Usage

1.  **Ingest** stock market data via Airflow.
2.  **Transform** and clean data using Spark.
3.  **Store** processed data in PostgreSQL for easy querying.
4.  **Visualize** the data in Tableau to gain insights into stock performance.
5.  **Monitor** the entire pipeline using the ELK stack and receive alerts for any issues.
