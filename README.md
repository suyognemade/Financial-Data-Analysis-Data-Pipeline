## Overview

This project builds a scalable and reliable **data pipeline** designed to process, analyze, and visualize **company stock data**. The pipeline automates data ingestion, transformation, and analysis, providing financial analysts, traders, and stakeholders with valuable insights into stock performance and market trends.

The pipeline uses **Apache Spark** for data transformation, **AWS S3** for scalable storage, **PostgreSQL** for structured querying, and **Tableau** for real-time dashboards. The **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) is used for monitoring pipeline health and performance, while **Gmail** is integrated to send automated notifications of pipeline status or stock alerts.

## Architecture

![Financial data pipeline drawio](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ee656c8-4b92-4e01-ae14-9878ac2ee8c2)

The architecture consists of multiple stages to handle the ingestion, transformation, storage, and visualization of stock data. Below is a high-level breakdown:

1. **Ingestion**: Data from stock market APIs (like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance) is ingested into **AWS S3** using **Apache Airflow** for orchestration.
2. **Transformation**: **Apache Spark** processes the raw data, calculating metrics such as moving averages, volatility, and price-to-earnings ratios.
3. **Storage**: Transformed data is stored in **PostgreSQL**, a relational database on AWS.
4. **Visualization**: **Tableau** connects to PostgreSQL and provides real-time dashboards for stock analysis.
5. **Monitoring**: The **ELK Stack** monitors pipeline performance, while **Filebeat** collects logs from each stage and forwards them to **Logstash**. **Kibana** visualizes log data, and alerts are sent via **Gmail** for pipeline errors or stock price notifications.

## Features


## 1. Ingesting Financial Data
The pipeline ingests large volumes of financial data from various sources, including real-time stock price feeds, trading volumes, and historical market data. This raw data is stored in AWS S3.

- **Orchestration:** Apache Airflow manages the data ingestion process, pulling data from APIs or stock market data providers at regular intervals (e.g., every minute or every hour).
- **Key Benefit:** Using S3 and Airflow, we ensure that stock data is collected and stored efficiently, with the flexibility to scale as the number of companies and data points increases.

## 2. Transforming Financial Data
Once the data is ingested, Apache Spark processes and transforms it, calculating important financial metrics such as moving averages, volatility, price-to-earnings ratios, and other key indicators used in trading. The transformed data is then stored in S3 for further analysis.

- **Key Benefit:** Spark’s distributed computing power enables us to quickly process large amounts of stock data, providing timely insights into stock performance, market trends, and trading behaviors.

## 3. Financial Data Analysis
Apache Spark performs deeper analysis on the processed stock data, comparing company performance against industry benchmarks, detecting patterns like price trends, trade volumes, or market anomalies. This data is stored in a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS, making it easy to query and generate reports on various financial metrics.

- **Key Benefit:** With structured data in PostgreSQL, financial analysts can run complex queries to assess company performance, detect market trends, or identify investment opportunities.

## 4. Visualization and Reporting for Traders and Analysts
Tableau connects to the PostgreSQL database to visualize key stock metrics, trends, and insights. Dashboards provide real-time updates on stock performance, market volatility, and other financial indicators. Automated notifications via Gmail keep analysts informed of important market movements or stock price changes.

- **Key Benefit:** Tableau’s powerful visualization tools, combined with real-time data updates, allow traders and analysts to make data-driven decisions quickly, helping them stay on top of fast-moving market conditions.

## 5. Monitoring the Financial Data Pipeline
Continuous monitoring is crucial for a stock data pipeline, as financial data is time-sensitive. Logs generated during each stage of the pipeline—data ingestion, transformation, and analysis—are saved in AWS S3. Filebeat collects these logs and forwards them to Logstash, where they are processed and enriched. The logs are indexed in Elasticsearch, making it easy to search for issues or performance bottlenecks. Kibana visualizes the logs and tracks pipeline health, with alerts configured to trigger Gmail notifications for critical issues.

- **Key Benefit:** The ELK stack ensures real-time monitoring, allowing quick reactions to any issues such as slow processing times, data source failures, or system bottlenecks.

## Technologies Used

The project leverages a variety of tools for big data processing, orchestration, storage, and monitoring:

- **Apache Spark**: For distributed data processing and transformation.
- **AWS S3**: For raw and processed data storage.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing transformed data and running SQL queries.
- **Tableau**: For visualizing real-time stock performance dashboards.
- **Apache Airflow**: For scheduling and orchestrating the data ingestion and processing pipeline.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: For monitoring the pipeline, collecting logs, and creating alerts.
- **Filebeat**: To forward log data from various pipeline stages to Logstash.
- **Gmail**: For sending email notifications of stock alerts or pipeline failures.
